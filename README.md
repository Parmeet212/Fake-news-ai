Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning
This project is focused on combating the spread of misinformation by identifying fake news articles using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to analyze and evaluate the credibility of news content by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms. Users can input a news headline or article, and the model will assess whether the content is likely to be fake or real, based on patterns learned from a labeled dataset of news stories.

The core of the project involves training a machine learning model on preprocessed news data, using techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression (or other classification models). The end result is a user-friendly tool that simplifies the task of fact-checking by allowing users to verify news content quickly and efficiently.

This project not only demonstrates practical applications of machine learning and NLP but also aims to contribute toward digital literacy and informed online engagement.
